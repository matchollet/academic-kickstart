The project Breaking Bad Behaviors, initiated by researchers from Universität Würzburg, aims at creating a platform to teach classroom management skills to new teachers. With colleagues from Ecole Nationale d'Ingénieurs de Brest, we are now combining our research expertise to improve the existing prototype with perceptually validated behavior models for the virtual students, and with interactive storytelling techniques to manage the learning scenarios.
