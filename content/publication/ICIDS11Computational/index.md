abstract = "Generating interactive narratives as movies requires knowledge in cinematography (camera placement, framing, lighting) and film editing (cutting between cameras). We present a framework for generating a well-edited movie from interactively generated scene contents and cameras. Our system computes a sequence of shots by simultaneously choosing which camera to use, when to cut in and out of the shot, and which camera to cut to."
