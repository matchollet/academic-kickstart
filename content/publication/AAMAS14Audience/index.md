abstract = "We have developed an interactive virtual audience platform for public speaking training. Users' public speaking behavior is automatically analyzed using audiovisual sensors. The virtual characters display indirect feedback depending on user's behavior descriptors correlated with public speaking performance. We used the system to collect a dataset of public speaking performances in different training conditions."
