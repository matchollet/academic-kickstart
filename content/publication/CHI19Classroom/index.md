abstract = "We propose the integration of interactive narrative techniques for audience atmosphere generation in Virtual Reality (VR) training systems. Such a combination provides a number of advantages when compared with current atmosphere generation techniques as outlined in this paper. Features of recent Interactive Storytelling (IS) prototypes can be extended to automatically adapt the atmosphere produced by a group of virtual humans in response to user intervention, while still staying coherent with the unfolding training scenario story. This work is currently being developed in the context of a VR training for teachers, in which they learn to manage a difficult classroom under the guidance of an instructor. We believe our interactive, narrative-driven atmosphere generation approach and prototype will interest the CHI community working on autonomous virtual humans for training, educational or social applications"
