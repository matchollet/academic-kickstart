abstract: "The use of robotic surgical systems disrupts existing team dynamics inside operating rooms and constitutes a major challenge for the development of crucial non-technical skills such as situation awareness (SA). Techniques for assessing SA mostly rely on subjective assessments and questionnaires; few leverage multimodal measures combining physiological, behavioural, and subjective indicators. We propose a conceptual model relating SA with mental workload, stress and communication, supported by measurable behaviours and physiological signals. To validate this model, we collect subjective, behavioural, and physiological data from surgical teams performing radical prostatectomy using robotic surgical systems. Statistical analyses will be performed to establish relationships between SA, subjective assessment of stress and mental workload, communication processes, and the surgeons' physiological signals."
