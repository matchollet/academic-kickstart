abstract= "Within this chapter, we are presenting how game developers could take inspiration from the research in Embodied Conversational Agent to develop non-player characters capable of expressing believable emotional and social reactions. Inspired  by  the  social  theories  about human emotional and social reactions,  the researchers  working  with  Embodied  Conversational  Agents  developed  different computational models to reproduce these human mechanisms within virtual characters. We are listing some of these works, comparing the different approaches and theories considered."
